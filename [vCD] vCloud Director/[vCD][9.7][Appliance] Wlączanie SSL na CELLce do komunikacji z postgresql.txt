To  re-enable SSL communication from the Primary Cell's vCD service to the database as this appears to be disabled and the vCD appliances use SSL communication by default.
The steps to enable this effectively are those from the vCD documentation here, https://docs.vmware.com/en/vCloud-Director/10.0/com.vmware.vcloud.install.doc/GUID-2BEE464F-F300-42A3-94B3-99DE7B59E8EC.html.
We can perform these steps together after completing those above:

    1. On the Primary vCD Cells confirm that there is no SSL config present for the connection to the database:
    
        grep 'database.jdbcUrl' /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/etc/global.properties
        
        If SSL is disabled we will see the following:
        
        database.jdbcUrl = jdbc:postgresql://X.X.0.49:5432/vcloud?socketTimeout=90
        
        If SSL was enabled we expect a value similar to the following:
        
        database.jdbcUrl=jdbc:postgresql://X.X.0.49:5432/vcloud?socketTimeout=90&sslfactory=com.vmware.vcloud.common.ssl.PostgresLocalTruststoreValidatingSocketFactory&ssl=true
        
    2. If SSL communication is disabled we will need to stop the vCloud Director Cell services and enable it.
        Shut down the vCloud Director Cell service:
    
        /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/bin/cell-management-tool cell -i $(top -u vcloud -b1 -s1 -n1 | grep java | head -n1 | awk '{print $1}') -s
    
    3. To enable SSL communication we can run the command from the documentation above:
    
        /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/bin/cell-management-tool reconfigure-database --database-ssl true
        
    4. We can then confirm that the SSL setting is set:
    
        grep 'database.jdbcUrl' /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/etc/global.properties
        
    5. Finally we can restart vCloud Director's Cell service:
    
        systemctl start vmware-vcd
